### Clause representation of CNF formulas

CNF: $$\bigwedge_{i=1}^{k} \bigvee_{j=1}^{n_{i}} L_{i,j}$$Set representation: $$\{\{ L_{i,j} \mid 1 \leq j \leq n_{i}\} \mid 1 \leq i \leq k\}$$
**clause** = disjunctive set of literals → CNF corresponds to set of clauses
- empty clause: $\bot$
- empty set of clauses: $\top$

set representation automatically implements #commutativity , #associativity , #idempotence

## Intuition behind resolution

- find relations with $$C_{1} \land C_{2} \vDash C_{3}$$to make information explicit
- if we find $\bot$, we know there is no model

how to generate new clauses?
- if clause $C_{1}$ tells us $X_{1}\rightarrow A$ and $C_{2}$ tells us $A\rightarrow X_{2}$ then we also know $X_{1}\rightarrow X_{2}$

## Resolvent

>for a literal $L$, we define $$\overline{L} = \begin{cases}
\neg A_{i}  & L = A_{i} \\
A_{i} & L = \neg A_{i}
\end{cases}$$

>for clauses $C_{1}, C_{2}$ and a literal $L$ with $L\in C_{1}$ and $\overline{L}\in C_{2}$, the clause $$(C_{1}\setminus \{L\})\cup(C_{2}\setminus \{\overline{L}\})$$is a **resolvent** of $C_{1}$ and $C_{2}$ and the process of deriving a resolvent is called a **resolution step**

>**resolution proof**: $$F\vdash_{Res} C$$if there is a sequence of clauses $C_{0}, \dots, C_{n}$ s.t.
>1. $C_{i}\in F$ or $C_{i}$ resolvent of $C_{a}, C_{b}$ with $a, b < i$
>2. $C_{n} = C$

#### Correctness of Resolution

#resolutionlemma:
> if $R$ resolvent of $C_{1}, C_{2}$, then $C_{1}, C_{2} \vDash R$

#resolutioncorrectness:
>let $F$ be a set of clauses. if $F \vdash_{Res} C$ then $F \vDash C$

>$F \vdash_{Res} \Box$ iff $F$ unsatisfiable

#### Completeness of Resolution

#resolutioncompleteness:
>let $F$ be a set of clauses. if $F$ unsatisfiable $ then $F \vdash_{Res} \Box$

proof: induction on number of atomic formulas
- n=0
	- formula is either $\bot$ or $\top$
- n → n+1
	- pick a variable $A_{i}$
	- set $A_{i}$ to false: remove occurrences of $A_{i}$ and clauses with $\neg A_{i}$
	- set $A_{i}$ to true: remove occurrences of $\neg A_{i}$ and clauses with $A_{i}$
	- two new formulas: only $n$ variables → apply IH

*NOTE: we can reintroduce the removed variable to the resolution trees of the two split formulas and arrive at the two clauses $\{A_{i}\}$ and $\{\neg A_{i}\}$, which resolves to $\Box$*
