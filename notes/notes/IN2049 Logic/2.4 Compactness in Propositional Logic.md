## Compactness Theorem 

#compactnesstheorem
> a set $S$ of formulas is **satisfiable** iff **every finite subset** of $S$ is **satisfiable**
> or: a set $S$ of formulas is **un**satisfiable iff **some** finite subset of $S$ is **un**satisfiable

intuition: finite witness

proof:
- $S$ → every finite subset: trivial
-  $S$ ← every finite subset: prove there is a model for $S$ 

#### Proving the compactness theorem

- terminology: $\mathcal{A}$ is a $b_{1}, \dots, b_{n}$ model of $T$ if $\mathcal{A}(A_{i}) = b_{i}$ and $\mathcal{A} \vDash T$
- define infinite sequence $b_{1}, b_{2}, \dots$ recursively: $$b_{n+1} = \text{some }b\in\{0, 1\} \text{ s.t. all finite } T\subseteq S \text{ have a }b_{1}, \dots , b_{n},b \text{ model}$$i.e. we know all our finite subsets and choose assignments s.t. all subsets stay satisfiable

1. for all $n$, all finite $T\subseteq S$ have a $b_{1}, \dots, b_{n}$ model (we can fix the first $n$ variables)
	- proof by induction on $n$
2. for $\mathcal{B}(A_{i})=b_{i}$ for all $i$, we have $\mathcal{B} \vDash S$ (we set our assignments)
	- reasoning: all formulas have a $b_{1}, \dots, b_{max}$ model

entailment version:
>if $S \vDash F$ then there is a finite subset $M \subseteq S$ s.t. $M \vDash F$


#### Application: Graph Coloring

> a finite planar graph has a 4-coloring

>a planar graph with countably many vertices is 4-colorable

proof: 
- construct set of formulas $S$ s.t. $S$ satisfiable iff $G$ is 4-colorable
- by earlier theorem: every finite subgraph is planar and 4-col
- every finite subset of $S$ is sat
- $S$ is sat by compactness
- $G$ is 4-col
