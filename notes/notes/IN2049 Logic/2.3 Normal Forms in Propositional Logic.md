## Negation Normal Form

>**literal**: atom (positive literal) or negation of atom (negative literal)

>**negation normal form**: negation only occurs directly in front of atoms 
> #nnf

##### Transformation into NNF:
push $\neg$ inwards with equivalences: $$\begin{align*}
\neg\neg F &\equiv F\\
\neg(F\land G) &\equiv (\neg F\lor\neg G)\\
\neg(F\lor G) &\equiv (\neg F\land\neg G)
\end{align*}$$
- terminates: proof by ranking function
- uniqueness: proof via [Church-Rosser property](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church%E2%80%93Rosser_theorem)

## CNF and DNF

>**conjunctive normal form**: conjunction of disjunctions of literals #cnf $$F = \bigwedge_{i=1}^{n} \bigvee_{j=1}^{m_{i}} L_{i,j}$$**disjunctive normal form:** disjunction of conjunctions of literals #dnf $$F =  \bigvee_{i=1}^{n} \bigwedge_{j=1}^{m_i} L_{i,j}$$where $L_{i,j}\in \{A_{1}, A_{2}, \dots\}\cup\{\neg A_{1}, \neg A_{2}, \dots\}$

#### Transformation into CNF or DNF

1. transform formula into NNF
2. apply equivalences from left to right as long as possible
	-  for transformation into CNF:$$\begin{align*}
F\lor(G\land H) &\equiv ((F\lor G)\land (F\lor H))\\
(F\land G)\lor H &\equiv ((F\lor H) \land (G\lor H))
\end{align*}$$
	-  for transformation into DNF:$$\begin{align*}
F\land(G\lor H) &\equiv ((F\land G)\lor (F\land H))\\
(F\lor G)\land H &\equiv ((F\land H) \lor (G\land H))
\end{align*}$$
- this terminates because: ...
- uniqueness: 

#### Complexity

- transformation as is: $\mathcal{O}(2^n)$
- this uses equivalence

>**equisatisfiability**: $F$ satisfiable iff $G$ satisfiable

>formula $F$ of size $n$ has *equisatisfiable* CNF formula $G$ of size $\mathcal{O}(n)$

>formula $F$ of size $n$ has *equivalid* DNF formula $G$ of size $\mathcal{O}(N)$

#### Validity

- CNF: can be checked in linear time:
	- formula valid iff all disjunctions are valid
	- disjunction valid iff contains both $A$ and $\neg A$ as literals
- DNF: co-NP-complete
	- standard procedure: transform into Def-CNF, then apply efficient SAT solver

#### Satisfiability

- DNF: can be checked in linear time:
	- formula satisfiable iff at least one conjunction is satisfiable
	- conjunction satisfiable iff not contains both $A$ and $\neg A$ as literals
- CNF: NP-complete
	- every formula can be converted into CNF

## Definitional CNF / [Tseytin's transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tseytin_transformation)

constructive definition of #tseytin or #defcnf
1. replace subformulas $G$ (from original formula) of form $\neg A'$, $A'\land B'$ or $A'\lor B'$ by new atom $A$
2. conjoin $A\leftrightarrow G$ (add with $\land$)
3. translate biimplications into CNF

→ is of size $\mathcal{O}(n)$ bc replacements + conversions increase size only by constants

constructing assignments:
1. consider previous assignment that makes old formula true
2. look at biimplications: calculate truth values of subformulas
3. other direction: just take a subset

*NOTE: the result is a formula where each clause has at most 3 literals → for each formula, there is an equisatisfiable formula in CNF with at most 3 literals per clause*

#### Substitutions

substitution in formulas:
>$F[G/A]$ denotes result of replacing all occurrences of atom $A$ in $F$ by $G$

substitution in assignments:
>$\mathcal{A}[v/A]$ denotes modified version of $\mathcal{A}$: $$(\mathcal{A}[v/A])(A_{i})=\begin{cases}v & A_{i}=A \\ \mathcal{A}(A_{i)}&\text{ otherwise}\end{cases}$$

##### Lemma: #substitutionlemma 
>$\mathcal{A}(F[G/A])= A'(F)$ where $\mathcal{A}' = \mathcal{A}[\mathcal{A}(G)/A]$
>substituting in the formula and keeping the original assignment produces the same result as keeping the original formula and substituting in the assignment

proof by structural induction on $F$

#### Correctness of definitional CNF

each replacement step produces an equisatisfiable formula:
- let $A$ be an atom that does not occur in $G$, then $F[G/A]$ is equisatisfiable with $F\land (A\leftrightarrow G)$
- proof uses #coincidencelemma and #substitutionlemma

## SAT
= satisfiability problem

- truth tables: take exponential time in worst case
- exceptions that can be decided in polynomial time:
	- #horn formulas
	- 2-CNF formulas
	- X-CNF formulas where clauses are of form $(A \oplus B)$

----

## Horn formulas

>**Horn formula**: formula in CNF where every disjunction contains max one positive literal
> #horn

- disjunction in a Horn formula can be seen as an implication $K\rightarrow B$ which are either
	- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">rules</mark>: $K$ is a conjunction of atoms
	- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">facts</mark>: $K=\top$ and $B$ is an atom
	- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">goals</mark>: $B = \bot$
	- can (one of the) goals be true if facts and rules hold?
	- if conjunction of all is unsatisfiable, then prerequisites ($K$) of goals must be true 

#### Fun property of Horn formulas
| assignment                                 | $A_{1}$ | $A_2$ | $A_{3}$ | $A_{4}$ |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------- | ----- | ------- | ------- |
| $\mathcal{A}_{1}$                          | 1       | 0     | 0       | 1       |
| $\mathcal{A}_{2}$                          | 1       | 1     | 0       | 0       |
| $\min\{\mathcal{A}_{1}, \mathcal{A}_{2}\}$ | 1       | 0     | 0       | 0        |

>if two assignments $\mathcal{A}_{1}$ and $\mathcal{A}_{2}$ make a formula true, then $\min\{\mathcal{A}_{1}, \mathcal{A}_{2}\}$ makes the formula true

*WHY?*
- consider $A_{1} \land A_{2}\land A_{3} \rightarrow B$ 
	- general Horn formula
- to make this formula false under the minimum assignment, we need $\min(\mathcal{A}_{1}, \mathcal{A}_{2}) = 1$ for $A_{1}, A_{2}, A_{3}$ and $0$ for $B$
- the first part means both assignments make all $A_{i}$ $1$
- the second part would mean at least one assignment makes $B$ $0$.... but then that would make the formula false under the corresponding original assignment!

*WHY ONLY WHEN AT MOST 1 POSITIVE LITERAL?*
- 2 positive literals would produce a formula of form $\bigwedge A_{i} \rightarrow B_{1}\lor B_{2}$
- now, either assignment could just make one $B_{1}$ true which would result in a minimum assignment where the conclusion is $0$
- 

#### Satisfiability check #hornSAT-algo
```Model building algorithm
for all atoms Ai in F do M(Ai) := 0
while 
	F has subformula K -> B s.t. M(K) = 1 and M(B) = 0
do
	if B = false then 
		return "unsatisfiable"
	else 
		M(B) := 1
return "satisfiable"
```

intuition:
- initially, the formulas $K \rightarrow B$ with $M(K)=1$ and $M(B)=0$ will be facts
- then, we set the rhs of facts to true, which propagates through rules

complexity: $\mathcal{O}(|F|^{2})$ → @Dowling1984LinearTimeAF

## 2-CNF formulas / Krom formulas

>**2-CNF formula**: formula $F$ in CNF s.t. every clause has at most 2 literals #2CNF

for a literal $L$ define $$\overline{L} := \begin{cases}
p & L = \neg p \\
\neg p & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}$$in other words: no double negations!

>**implication graph** of 2-CNF fomula $F$ := directed graph $\mathcal{G}=(V, E)$ where$$V := \{p_{1}, p_{2}, \dots, p_{n}\} \cup \{\neg p_{1}, \neg p_{2}, \dots, \neg p_{n}\}$$and the $p_{i}$ are the propositional variables mentioned in $F$
>for each pair of literals $L$ and $M$: $(L, M) \in E$ iff ($\overline{L} \lor M$) or $(M \lor \overline{L})$ appear in $F$

- paths in $\mathcal{G}$ correspond to implication chains
- contrapositive implications: $(\overline{M}, \overline{L})$ corresponds to $(L, M)$
- graph is **consistent** if no $p$ has paths from $p$ to $\neg p$ and vice versa
- satisfiability: reduces to reachability in implication graph

>2-CNF formula $F$ is satisfiable iff implication graph $\mathcal{G}$ is consistent

##### 2-SAT algorithm #2SAT-algo
```
input: 2-CNF formula F
A := empty valuation/assignment

while 
	there is some unassigned variable
do
	pick literal L with no path to -L
	set A(L) := 1
	while
		there is an edge (M, N) with A(M) = 1 and A(N) undefined
	do
		A(N) := 1
return A
```

- outer loop invariant: nodes reachable from true node are also true
- inner loop invariant: no paths from true to false node

## Randomised algorithms

#### Walk-SAT

```
guess assignment
while
	there is unsatisfied clause F
do
	pick literal and flip truth value
if no satisfying assignment after r steps
	return UNSAT
```
- if formula unsatisfiable, algorithm will say so
- $r$ should be large enough to give satisfying assignments a chance to emerge
- consider Hamming distance
	- each flip has probability $0.5$ of moving us one step closer/further away from assignment
