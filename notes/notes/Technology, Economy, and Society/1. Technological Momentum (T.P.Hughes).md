Notes:
- **"technical"** here means physical artifacts and software (102)
- **"technology"** here means technological or sociotechnical systems (102)
- **"society"** here means "the world that is not technical, or that is not hardware or technical software" and includes e.g. institutions, values, interest groups, social classes, political/economic forces (102)
- **"technological systems"** includes both the technical and the social

##### EBASCO example:
- electric utility holding company
- mature technological system
- controlled electric utiliy companies → transitively: technical subsystems (light/power networks/grids)
- investors/engineers/managers → synergy between services
- other parties involved:
	- General Electric Company → influenced EBASCO policies
	- engineering colleges → research/consulting
	- state authorities
- technical focus: Hughes considers it a technological system
- timeline: <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">creation/early history of a system has a more technical focus (engineers, scientists, workers), as it matures, the focus is on maintaining and expanding it (managers, white-collar employees)</mark> → becomes more social in time

##### EBASCO cause and effect:
- deterministic approach: technical core caused change in social components/society in general
	- e.g.: generators → factory floor reorganization/[Fordism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fordism)
	- street/workplace/home lighting → different working hours and nature of work/play
	- electrical appliances → different work for women
	- layout of power lines → demographic change (decentralized regionalism)
- constructivistic approach: technical core as an effect
	- population growth + industrialization → higher real estate prices → new turbine-driven power plants and high-voltage lines into cities
	- regulations
	- values

### Technological Momentum

>"as the [...] system became larger and more complex, thereby gathering **momentum**, the system became less **shaped by** and more **the shaper of** its environment" (108)

characteristics of technological momentum:
- only broken/deflected by large historical event (Great Depression, 108)
- acquired skill and knowledge → transfer to new problems
- special-purpose machines/processes
- enormous physical structures
- organizational bureaucracy
- experience is organized and rationalized → informs new generation → new applications

![[BASF.svg]]

- **economies of scope** consider momentum embodied in large physical structures (110)
	- "solution looking for a problem"
- momentum provides durability and propensity for growth (111)
	- in the past more commonly associated with spread of bureaucracy

## Session Notes

- Hughes' Opus Mganum: 'Networks of Power'
	- double meaning: electrical power + social power

### Momentum

- newtonian mechanics: momentum = product of mass and velocity of an object

### Hughes: Human-Build world

- cover image: similar to "Wanderer über dem Nebelmeer" by C.D. Friedrich, but with industrial buildings instead of nature
- meta-critique: <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">people simplify technology</mark>
- technology has "complex and varied character" which has to be understoff io2 "use it more effectively as means to a wide variety of ends"
- technology as craftsmen, mechanics, inventors, enginners, designers, scientists → <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">technology as people</mark>

### Power plant image: visible vs invisible

- visible: factory
- invisible: money, management, exmployees, carbon footprint

### Haber process

- [Wikipedia article](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haber-Bosch-Verfahren)
	- ammonia "out of thin air"
	- [video abt Haber;s life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvknN89JoWo)
	- nitrates/ammonia essential for fertilizers, but also munition

aim and product: producing ammonia/nitrates at a large scale

success: 
- demand
- external influences
- previous experience
- multiple applications
- political/industrial system

failures/frustrations:
- touched on a bit: scaling

### Technical determinism

- technical core causes change in social components
- quite rigid
